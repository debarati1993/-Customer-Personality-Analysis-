# -Customer-Personality-Analysis-
### * **Objective:**
#### * The primary goal of this project is to perform a detailed Customer Personality Analysis to help a business better understand its customers and optimize its marketing strategies.         By shifting from a "one-size-fits-all" approach to a data-driven targeted strategy, the business can improve customer engagement and maximize return on investment (ROI).

#### * The project is divided into two core phases:
    
####    1. **Customer Segmentation (Unsupervised Learning):**  To analyze customer demographics, spending patterns across various product categories (Wines, Fruits, Meat, etc.), and purchasing channels.
 ####   2. **Response Prediction (Supervised Learning):** To develop a predictive classification model that identifies which customers are most likely to respond to a marketing campaign.
